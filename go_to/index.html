<p> I would like to apply for the role of Go-To Digital Marketing Coordinator.</p>
<h3> Why am I perfect for the position?</h3>
<section id ="parttwo">
<h3> Why do I want the position?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go-To is a killer brand. I love the spunky brand personality and unique tone of voice. I am in awe of the continuous diversification and growth of the brand. Zoë Foster Blake is an incredible entrepreneur and I know the brand will continue to grow and thrive.</li>
<li>I love digital marketing and data excites me.</li>
<li>I love Go-To products (I have the whole range in my colour coordinated beauty cupboard.)</li>
</ol>
